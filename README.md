# Zwannah API Structure Documentation (Actors-Supporters Arrangement)

## Introduction
The **Zwannah API Structure (Actors-Supporters Arrangement)** (ZAS or ASA) specifies how files in an API (that's based on scripting language) should be arranged to enhance security, maintenance, and tools usage. Tools usage means using tools such as file includers and others efficiently. With this structure, it is easy to write and create tools that ensure development meets organizational conventions and standards.

## ZAS Naming Conventions
1. **directory names:** All directory names should be lowercase with no dividers such as underscores or dashes.
2. **filenames:** all file names should be lowercase with no dividers such as underscores or dashes.
3. **extensions:** the file extension should reflect its purpose. for example, "user.php" that holds a user class code should be named "user.class.php" or any preceeding extension as chosen by the organization before the language's extension. For example, "user.class.php" could be "user.c.php".
